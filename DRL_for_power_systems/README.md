# Learning to apply (Deep) Reinforcement Learning for Power Systems

There are three differen task baout learning to apply RL in differen t einvironment settings. Further Their is one challenge included that should help how DRL can be utilized in power system related problem formulations.
For applying the algorithms the packages "gym" for initalizing the environment and "pytprch" for implementing the neuronal networks are used. The detailed package requiremnts are included in the begining of each indivdual notebook.

The task cover the following RL Algorithms below. A more detailed discription about each task and their application is given in the notebooks respectively.
## Q-Learning

Walking through how to apply Tabular Q Learning with the Taxi Driver environment

## Deep Q-Networks
Applying DQNs within the cart-pole environment

## DDPG
Learning about how to utlize actor-critic archiecture with in the mountain car environment

## Training an intelegent Battery storage system
