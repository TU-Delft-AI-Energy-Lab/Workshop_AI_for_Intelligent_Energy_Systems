# Learning to apply (Deep) Reinforcement Learning for Power Systems

There are three different learning tasks to apply RL in different environment settings. Further, There is one challenge included that should help how DRL can be utilized in power system-related problem formulations.
The packages "Gym" for initializing the environment and "Pytorch" for implementing the neuronal networks are used for applying the algorithms. The detailed package requirements are included at the beginning of each notebook.
Note: The blank Tasks are in the Blank folder, whereas the solutions are in Master.

The task covers the following RL Algorithms below. A more detailed description of each task and their application is given in the notebooks respectively.
## Q-Learning

Walking through how to apply Tabular Q Learning in the Taxi Driver environment

## Deep Q-Networks
Applying DQNs within the cart-pole environment

## DDPG
Learning about how to utilise actor-critic architecture within the mountain car environment

## Training an intelligent Battery storage system
